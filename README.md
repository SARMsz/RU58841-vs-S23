<h1>RU58841 vs S23 – My Experience With Both and What You Should Know</h1>

<p>RU58841 and S23 are very different compounds, but I’ve used both personally. One is used topically to stop hair loss, the other is one of the strongest SARMs ever made. In this article, I’ll break down what happened when I tested each one, what you can expect, and which is right for your goal—whether that’s <strong>preserving your hair or building insane muscle</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ll also link the exact sources I used for each compound at the bottom of their sections—these are trusted, tested, and not random resellers.</p>

<h2>RU58841 – Did It Actually Save My Hair?</h2>

<p><strong>RU58841</strong> is a non-steroidal anti-androgen. You apply it directly to your scalp to block DHT at the follicle level. I’ve been using it for over 8 months now. I use it every night at <strong>50mg per application</strong> on thinning areas of my hairline and crown.</p>

<h3>My Results with RU58841:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Noticeable reduction in shedding after 2 weeks</li>
  <li>Hairline stopped receding after 1 month</li>
  <li>Baby hairs started growing back after 3 months</li>
  <li>No sides like low libido or mood swings (unlike oral finasteride)</li>
</ul>

<p>I was skeptical at first, but RU58841 absolutely works—as long as you’re consistent. It doesn’t regrow thick hair overnight, but it <strong>definitely stops DHT from destroying your follicles</strong>. I still stack it with ketoconazole shampoo for maximum effect.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Stops DHT at the scalp only (no systemic side effects)</li>
  <li>Easy to apply once daily</li>
  <li>Noticeable reduction in hair loss</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Needs daily application to work</li>
  <li>Expensive if used long-term</li>
  <li>Not FDA approved (still research use)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Hair loss prevention, especially if you're using androgens like SARMs or testosterone</p>

<h2>S23 – The Strongest SARM I’ve Ever Used</h2>

<p><strong>S23</strong> is next-level. It’s a <strong>non-steroidal SARM</strong> that’s insanely strong and highly suppressive. I ran it for 6 weeks at <strong>20mg/day</strong> during a hard cut. This stuff made me look like a machine—but it came at a cost.</p>

<h3>My Results with S23:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Full, dry, grainy muscle definition by Week 3</li>
  <li>Strength increase in all major lifts despite calorie deficit</li>
  <li>Insane vascularity and fat loss</li>
  <li>Major suppression—my test levels crashed without PCT</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to look peeled and vascular, S23 will do it fast. But it’s not for casual users. I felt test suppression hard by Week 4—low libido, lethargy, and mood dips. I needed a full PCT to recover. But in terms of pure physique change, this was the most dramatic transformation I’ve ever had from any compound.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Extreme fat loss and muscle hardness</li>
  <li>Boosts strength even in a deficit</li>
  <li>Great for short-term photo shoots or competitions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Highly suppressive</li>
  <li>Can mess with sleep and libido</li>
  <li>Not suitable for beginners</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Cutting, Pre-contest prep, Experienced users</p>

<h2>RU58841 vs S23 – What Are You Trying to Achieve?</h2>

<p>This isn’t apples to apples. RU58841 is topical and targets hair follicles. S23 is systemic and targets muscle tissue. But if you’re using strong SARMs like S23, your DHT will spike—and RU58841 becomes a must-have.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to keep your hair and stay on cycle, RU58841 is a no-brainer.</strong> If you want to shred body fat and look dry as hell, S23 is your weapon—but make sure you have PCT ready.</p>

<h2>How I Test These Compounds</h2>

<p>Everything I write comes from personal experience. Here’s how I test:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One compound at a time (no stacks during testing)</li>
  <li>Bloodwork before and after cycle</li>
  <li>Track strength, weight, libido, and hair density</li>
  <li>Controlled diet and training plan to isolate results</li>
</ul>

<p>I also keep a journal every day to document energy, sleep, mood, and sides. This isn’t theory—it’s real-world use over months, not weeks.</p>
